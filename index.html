		<p>My name is Björn Englesson and I have a Bachelor in Computer Science and I am studying to become a Master of Science in Human Computer Interaction at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. Besides school I have been the project leader for the orientation of new Computer Science students at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. I am interested in virtual reality, augmented reality and user experience. I like challenges and am not afraid of throwing myself into new situations. I believe that is the best way of learning new things; learning by doing.

	  	<p><strong>Glimpse</strong></p>
	 	<p>A school project in which I created an augmented reality application for iOS and Android which could look into virtual windows placed on real walls together with five other people. I was responsible for the AR part and putting together the scenes. The application was developed using Unity and Vuforia. A demo video can be seen <a href="https://youtu.be/zYMCY2kFxso">here</a> and our website can be found <a href="https://glimpseagi.wordpress.com/">here</a>.

	  	<p><strong>God-like Third Person VR Concept</strong></p>
	 	<p>While creating the electrical wheelchair puzzle we also discussed creating a puzzle game from the perspective of a god looking down on a third person character. I wanted to try that concept out and created a very basic demo over a weekend consisting of the new perspective and a small level using assets from the wheelchair puzzle. A short video showing the demo can be seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uX8Pzwu-C_k">here</a>. This demo was created in Unreal Engine 4 using the HTC Vive as the VR headset.

	  	<p><strong>Electrical Wheelchair VR Puzzle Demo</strong></p>
	 	<p>During the summer of 2016, my friends and I created a small virtual reality puzzle game for the HTC Vive. We were interested in how to approach the problem of movement in virtual reality so we decided to give a virtual electrical wheelchair a try. The puzzle game was created using Unreal Engine 4 and the HTC Vive. A video of the demo can be seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/03g4BAvUr1k">here</a>.
